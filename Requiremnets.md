### **Project Requirements Document**

---

#### **1. Project Overview**

The **User Profile Management System** is an online service that allows users to create and update their personal profiles, which include their bio (a short description about themselves) and their profile photo. The system is designed to ensure that only authorized users can create or change their profiles. It will also ensure that if any error happens while updating a profile, all changes are undone to maintain data consistency.

---

#### **2. Objectives**

The main goals of the project are:

- **Allow users to create a profile**: Users should be able to provide their bio and profile photo.
- **Allow users to update their profile**: Users can edit their bio and change their photo.
- **Ensure secure access**: Only logged-in users can access or change their profile.
- **Keep data safe**: If something goes wrong during a profile update, the system will undo any changes to keep data consistent.

#### **3. Features**

Here are the main features of the system:

##### **3.1 User Authentication**

- **Login**: Users need to log in to use the system. This is done by sending a secure token (like a special password) with every request.
- **Security**: If a user is not logged in or if the token is invalid, they won’t be able to access their profile.

##### **3.2 Profile Creation and Update**

- **Profile Creation**: A new user can create their profile with their bio and profile photo.
- **Profile Update**: Users can change their bio or profile photo anytime.
- **Profile Link**: Each profile is connected to a specific user account. A user cannot create or edit someone else's profile.

##### **3.3 Data Integrity**

- If anything goes wrong during the profile creation or update (like a system crash), the system will undo all changes to prevent incorrect data from being saved.

##### **3.4 Error Handling**

- **Invalid Token**: If the token (the user’s proof of login) is expired or incorrect, the system will deny access with a clear error message.
- **Existing Profile**: If a user tries to create a profile when one already exists, the system will give an error to avoid duplication.
- **Failed Operations**: If the system encounters an error while updating a profile (e.g., database issues), the changes will be undone to avoid leaving the data in an inconsistent state.

---

#### **4. Technical Requirements**

- **Scalability**: The system should be able to handle a growing number of users.
- **Security**: The system should ensure that only the correct user can access and edit their own profile.
- **Maintainability**: The system should be easy to update and fix if any issues arise.

#### **5. User Experience (How it works)**

##### **5.1 Logging In**

- Users need to log in by entering their credentials (like email and password).
- Once logged in, they will receive a special login token that allows them to securely access their profile.

##### **5.2 Creating a Profile**

- Once logged in, the user can create a profile by filling in their bio and uploading a profile photo.
- If everything is correct, their profile will be saved and linked to their user account.

##### **5.3 Updating a Profile**

- The user can update their bio and profile photo at any time by logging into their account.
- Once the updates are made, the system will save them.

##### **5.4 Error Handling**

- If a user tries to create a profile when one already exists, the system will inform them that a profile is already linked to their account.
- If the system encounters an issue (e.g., database error), any changes will be undone to ensure no incorrect information is saved.

#### **6. Example of Using the System**

##### **Example 1: Creating a Profile**

1. **Action**: User logs in and creates their profile by adding a short bio and uploading a photo.
2. **System Response**: The system saves the bio and photo, linking them to the user’s account.

##### **Example 2: Updating a Profile**

1. **Action**: User wants to update their bio and profile photo.
2. **System Response**: User submits the updated information, and the system saves the changes.

##### **Example 3: Error Handling**

1. **Action**: User tries to create a profile again (but already has one).
2. **System Response**: The system informs the user that a profile already exists and prevents duplication.

#### **7. Why This System is Useful**

- **Security**: Only authorized users can create or update their profile.
- **User Control**: Users can manage their own profile easily by updating their information whenever needed.
- **Data Consistency**: If something goes wrong, the system ensures that no incorrect information is saved.

### **In Summary**

This **User Profile Management System** makes it easy for users to securely manage their profiles, including creating and updating their bio and profile photo. The system ensures that only the rightful user can modify their profile, and it handles errors gracefully to maintain the integrity of user data.
